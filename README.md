Tasks done.

1. Integration of Material UI.
2. Nav bar fixed. Slides into the screen on click. Logo maybe added.
3. Made a consistent font, Judson serif from Google Fonts
4. Main screen improv: Split image into bg and fg.
5. Made image responsive layout (HOMEBANNER)
6. Tab1 Content .jsx page
7. Tab1 Content .css page
8. ArrowHeads. Responsive for handling arrow change.

Doubts :

1. What is the logo? Same as van cleef arpels?
2. There were 4 fonts being used. Is there a specific font needed? I have used Judson from google font. Which is free and open source.
3. Cors ERRORs. please add localhost:3000 to your backend. Will a vercel link do?
